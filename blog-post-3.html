                            <h1>Celebrating 70 Years of West Point, IA Sweet Corn Festival</h1>
                                <p>This year West Point, Iowa celebrates its 70th anniversary of the Sweet Corn Festival. What started as a small, local gathering has blossomed into a grand celebration of community spirit and agricultural pride.</p>

                            <h2>A Sweet Start</h2>
                                <p>The Sweet Corn Festival has humble beginnings. It all started in 1952 when a generous local farmer donated around 50 bushels of sweet corn to the community. The corn was boiled in a lard pot from the town’s locker plant and served alongside steak cooked on grills fashioned from halves of 55-gallon barrels. This simple, yet heartfelt gesture marked the beginning of what would grow into a cherished annual event.</p>
                        
                            <h2>A Tradition Grows</h2>
                            <p>As the festival gained popularity, it evolved into the vibrant celebration it is today. One notable tradition that has endured is the use of an antique steam engine to cook the sweet corn. Donated in the mid-1980s, this steam engine has become an integral part of the festival, cooking approximately 16 tons of sweet corn each year—and the number is only growing. The corn is served free to festival attendees, embodying the spirit of community and generosity.</p>

                            <h2>Event Highlights</h2>
